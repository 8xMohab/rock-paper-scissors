## My process

The app is devided into two stages Picking and Result stage and based on the current stage we render the right component. The fist component renders the items in the [Items](./src/GameLogic.js) list using the [Item](./src/features/item/Item.jsx) component.

Once the user picks an item we go to the "compare" stage where's a function called CalcWinner in [CalcWinner](./src/GameLogic.js) is used to determine the winner and returns an object containing the winner and House's pick.

Then the [Result](./src/features/Result.jsx) component renders the winner's and the House's pick, animates the result text ("You win/You lose/Draw"), play again button and updates the score.
